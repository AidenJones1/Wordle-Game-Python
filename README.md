# Wordle Game

## About
A simple Wordle game that can be played via the command prompt

## How it Works
Simply run the program in the command prompt, and the game will automatically start and wait for user input. Type a five-letter word and hit "enter" to submit, and the program will evaluate your guess letter by letter. The evaluation is as follows:

ðŸŸ© = Correct Letter and correct position

ðŸŸ¨ = The word contains that letter

ðŸŸ¥ = The word does not contain that letter

You can stop the program by typing "exit"
